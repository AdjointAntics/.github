## Summary

<!-- What does this PR do? Why? -->

## Test Plan

- [ ] `make test` passes
- [ ] Laws verified (if adding/modifying categorical abstractions)
- [ ] Docstrings on all public symbols
- [ ] No placeholder markers remain (`<!-- TODO`, `greet("Yoneda")`)

## Duality Check

<!-- If this adds a construction, does its dual exist (or is it planned)? -->

---

*Every construction has a dual. Every contribution has a home.*

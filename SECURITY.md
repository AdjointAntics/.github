# Security Policy

## Scope

AdjointAntics packages are mathematical libraries — they process algebraic structures, not user credentials or network traffic. The attack surface is small. The commitment to fixing vulnerabilities is not.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue in any AdjointAntics package, please report it responsibly:

1. **Do not** open a public issue
2. Email **adjointantics@gmail.com** with a description of the vulnerability
3. Include: affected package, Julia version, reproduction steps

We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours and aim to resolve confirmed vulnerabilities within 14 days.

## Supported Versions

We support the latest release of each package on Julia 1.10+. Older versions do not receive security patches.

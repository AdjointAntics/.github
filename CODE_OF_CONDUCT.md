# Code of Conduct

We build mathematical software together. The category theory is rigorous; the community should be welcoming. An adjunction pairs two perspectives — construction and observation — and this project pairs technical ambition with mutual respect.

## Our Pledge

We pledge to make participation in this project a respectful experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

**Encouraged:**

- Constructive feedback grounded in specifics
- Respectful disagreement — argue the idea, not the person
- Welcoming newcomers, especially those new to category theory
- Crediting prior work and acknowledging contributions

**Not tolerated:**

- Personal attacks, insults, or dismissive language
- Harassment in any form
- Publishing others' private information without consent
- Conduct that a reasonable person would consider inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing these standards. They may remove, edit, or reject contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct, and may temporarily or permanently ban contributors for behavior they deem inappropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces — issues, pull requests, discussions, and any other communication channel associated with AdjointAntics.

## Reporting

Report concerns to **adjointantics@gmail.com**. All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. Maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy of the reporter.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), version 2.1.

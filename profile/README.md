We write Julia libraries that take adjunctions seriously as an engineering discipline — not a curiosity, not a flex, but the computational structure behind differentiation, learning, and optimization.

Where [AlgebraicJulia](https://github.com/AlgebraicJulia) gives you categories as data structures, we're building categories as computational strategies — particularly the adjoint machinery (F ⊣ G) that drives autodiff, encoder-decoder architectures, and compositional inference.

The algebra should compile. The abstractions should vanish at runtime. The diagrams should commute.

## Open Questions

- Can the Para construction give Julia a categorical interface to gradient-based learning?
- What's the right comonadic semantics for streaming data and online inference?
- When does the free-forgetful pattern in type systems actually buy you performance?
- Is there a useful profunctor optics library waiting to be written in Julia?

If any of these keep you up at night — [open a discussion](https://github.com/orgs/AdjointAntics/discussions).

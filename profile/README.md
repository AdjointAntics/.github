Structure is not ornament. The same algebra that governs adjoint functors governs good software — composable, reversible, minimal.

We build tools at the boundary of category theory and machine intelligence, in Julia, with the conviction that the right abstraction eliminates the right complexity.

## Focus

| Domain | Objects |
|:--|:--|
| **Category Theory** | Adjunctions, comonads, Yoneda embeddings, universal constructions |
| **AI & Learning** | Categorical foundations for neural architectures, compositional reasoning |
| **Julia** | Type-driven libraries where the algebra compiles |

## Contribute

We welcome morphisms from all categories. If you think in diagrams and dream in functors — open an issue, submit a PR, or just star something that commutes.
